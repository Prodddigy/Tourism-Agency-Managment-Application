Travel Agency Management Application™ or TAMA™ is a project meant for travel agencies.
Software enables workers to create Tourism Packages (Trips) and enrol Clients onto them.
Each trip can be greatly customised starting from specifying date of the trip to choosing a specific type of, e.g. Pilgrimage.
Management of tourism packages is improved by dynamically changing and monitoring its status.
